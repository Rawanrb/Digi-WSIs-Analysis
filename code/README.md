# Source code for producing the results and figures

The code is divided between Python and R modules. The modules implement the methodology and code that is used
in the paper. This code is tested using `runme` which needs the data input to be entered by the user as CSV.

# R Codes
The `plots.R` and `survival.R` files contain the codes for survival analysis 
and the plots used and shown in the paper. 

## Python Code

The `survMl.py` file contains the implementation of 
survival machine learning algorithms that includes both SVM and RSF.

# R Codes
The two files contain the codes for survival analysis 
and the codes for all plots in the paper. 

# Source code for producing the results and figures

The code is divided between Python and R modules. The modules implement the methodology and code that is used
in the paper. This code is tested using `runme` which needs the data input to be entered by the user as CSV.


## Python Code

The `survMl.py` file contains the implementation of survival machine learning algorithm that includes both SVM and RSF.

## Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known to have relatively poor 
outcome with variable prognoses, raising the need for more informative 
risk stratification. We investigated a set of digital, artificial intelligence (AI) 
based spatial tumour microenvironment (sTME) features and explored their prognostic 
value in TNBC. After performing tissue classification on digitised Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) 
slides of TNBC cases, we employed a deep learning-based algorithm to segment tissue regions into tumour, 
stroma, and lymphocytes in order to compute quantitative features concerning the spatial relationship of 
tumour with lymphocytes and stroma. The prognostic value of the digital features was explored using survival 
analysis with Cox proportional hazard models in a cross-validation setting on two independent international 
multi-centric TNBC cohorts: The Australian Breast Cancer Tissue Bank (AUBC) cohort (n=318) and 
The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA) cohort (n = 111). The proposed digital stromal tumour infiltrating 
lymphocytes (Digi-sTILs) score and the digital tumour-associated stroma (Digi-TAS) score were found to carry strong 
prognostic value for disease-specific survival, with the Digi-sTILs and Digi-TAS scores giving C-index values of 0.65 (p = 0.0189) 
and 0.60 (p = 0.0437), respectively, on the TCGA cohort as a validation set. Combining the Digi-sTILs feature with the patientâ€™s 
positivity status for axillary lymph nodes yielded a C-index of 0.76 on unseen validation cohorts. We surmise that the proposed 
digital features could potentially be used for better risk stratification and management of TNBC patients.
